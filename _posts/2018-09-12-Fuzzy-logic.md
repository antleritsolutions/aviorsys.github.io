**A Fuzzy logic** based on the two truth values True and Fales is sometimes inadequate when
describing human reasoning. Fuzzy logic uses the whole interval between 0 (Fales) and 1
(True) to describe human reasoning. As a result, fuzzy logic is being applied in rule based
automatic controllers, and this reference is part of a course for control engineers.
