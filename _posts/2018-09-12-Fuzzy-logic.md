![Fuzzy Logic](https://github.com/aviorsys/aviorsys.github.io/raw/master/images/fuzzy-logic.PNG)

**A Fuzzy logic** based on the two truth values True and Fales is sometimes inadequate when
describing human reasoning. Fuzzy logic uses the whole interval between 0 (Fales) and 1
(True) to describe human reasoning. As a result, fuzzy logic is being applied in rule based
automatic controllers, and this reference is part of a course for control engineers.
