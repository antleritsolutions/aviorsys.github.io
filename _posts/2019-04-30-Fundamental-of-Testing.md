# Fundamentals of Testing

Today's digital world, software systems are everywhere.starting from business application to a
wide range of consumer products.

Errors and misbehavior of software systems are lead to many problems such as loss of money
and time and also business reputation.in worse situation, it might cause injury or death. To
overcome these problems and reduce adverse impact software systems should be thoroughly
tested before putting into operation.

Testing is one of the major phases of the software development life cycle.Testing starts from the
requirement gathering and it continues until the project delivered to the customer.
Testing covers different aspects such as,

- Functional
- Usability
- User friendliness
- Performance
- Security
- Reliability

Covering these aspects ensure that developed software meets customer and stakeholder
requirements.
There are a common set of activities including in the testing process.

- Test Planning
- Test Monitoring and Control
- Test Analysis
- Test Design
- Test Implementation
- Test Execution
- Test Completion

without these activities, testing will be less likely to achieve its established objectives.
Each phase consists of constituent activities and each activity in each phase consists of
individual tasks which would very from one project to another.
Exhaustive testing is impossible and not productive either.Testing scope and depth depends on,

- Budget and resources
- Timescales
- Complexity
- Contractual and regulatory requirements

Find defect early in testing saves money and time both.testing is necessary to overall software
development and maintenance success.
Rigorous testing of components and systems, can help reduce the risk of failures occurring
during operation. When defects are detected, and subsequently fixed, this contributes to the
quality of the components or systems.
